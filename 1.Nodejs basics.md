# Start of Node.js
- Nodejs is a JS `runtime evironment` through which js can be executed anywhere outside the web browser.
> JS Runtime Environment has everything to execute js code outside just understand it. 
- Initially js could run only on browsers but after nodejs it can run everywhere.

## V8 Engine
- V8 is the C++ program made by Google which reads the Javascript code and converts it to machine code.
- It follows `ECMAscript`.
> ECMAscript is the set of standard rules for scripting languages. Javascript follows ECMAscript.
- Nodejs has V8 embedded into it to read Javascript code and convert it to machine code.

> ### If Nodejs uses V8 then why not just put V8 on server to run js?
> Because V8 can only run javascript but cannot do any useful thing on server like database connection, open network ports, API calls, etc.

- JS code can be run on NodeJs REPL(Read Execute Print Loop) just like browser console because it also have same v8 engine inside it.
- When we write code, Node gives it to v8 inside it and v8 executes it.

## Global Object
- Every JS runtime environment provides a global object which has useful methods and data (like setTimeout, setInvterval, etc.)
- Before everywhere it's different like node has global as global object, browser have window, so in 2020 it was standardized that `globalThis` will be the global object in every JS runtime.
